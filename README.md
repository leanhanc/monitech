# N2

This is a template for starting a project with a N2-Stack (Next.js + Nest.js) written in TypeScript and organized in a monorepo powered by NX.

The N2-Stack provides a powerful combination of tools and technologies for building scalable, efficient, and modern web applications. With Next.js on the front-end and Nest.js on the back-end, you can take advantage of the benefits of both server-side and client-side rendering, while writing your code in TypeScript for improved type safety and better developer experience.

By using a monorepo powered by NX, you can manage multiple projects in a single codebase, share code and dependencies between them, and streamline your development workflow.
